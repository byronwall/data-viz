# Data Viz

## Major work remaining

- Allow saving chart state in a view
  - Ensure that everything is initialized from the saved state
- Brushing logic needs to generate a filter
- Global color scales for data
- Global color themes
- Add pivot tables
- Add calculation engine
- Improve UX everywhere
  - Settings needs a numeric input that works
  - Field picker at top needs to improve
- Allow controlling settings better
  - Grid layout
- Add support for faceting
- Add a filter summary + filter controller
- Wire up "load examples" buttons for main data sets
- Improve handling of times stamps

## Nice to haves

- Add GPS maps + data display
  - Figure out how to do chloropleth maps
- Add supporting for multiple data sources and relationships
- Add data isolation + "fork" modes - create tabbed interfaces for these

## Small problems

- Scatter plot needs to allow new drag filter on off-click if already brushed
