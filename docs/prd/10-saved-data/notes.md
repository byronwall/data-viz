# Notes

- Unchecking `color scale` on row chart does not remove the color scale.
- Scatter plot shows a "color field" and "color scale" as separate dropdowns?
- Bar chart does not remove color scale after unchecking color scale toggle
- Need to be able to clear the color field for the scatter plot - add a "clear" button
