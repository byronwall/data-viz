  - [x] Filter by color group when color field is present
  - [x] No action when no color field is selected
- [x] Implement axis labels
  - [x] Add x-axis label support
  - [x] Add y-axis label support
  - [x] Integrate with global chart settings
  - [x] Allow label overrides in chart settings

### Visual Improvements

- [x] Fix box coloring
  - [x] Apply color field values to box rectangles
  - [x] Ensure proper color inheritance from data
- [x] Add sorting controls
  - [x] Implement median-based sorting
  - [x] Implement x-label based sorting
  - [x] Add sorting controls to chart settings
- [x] Optimize violin plot
  - [x] Add bandwidth control setting
  - [x] Add to chart settings panel
- [x] Optimize bee swarm
  - [x] Implement random sampling for large datasets
  - [x] Set threshold at 1000 points
  - [x] Add sampling controls to chart settings

## Status

### Phase 1: Filtering and Interaction ✅

- [x] Color-based filtering
  - [x] Add color field to filter options
  - [x] Implement range filter for y-axis
- [x] Box click interaction
  - [x] Add click handler
  - [x] Implement color group filtering
- [x] Axis labels
  - [x] Add label support
  - [x] Integrate with settings

### Phase 2: Visual Improvements ✅

- [x] Box coloring
  - [x] Fix color application
  - [x] Test with various color fields
- [x] Sorting controls
  - [x] Add sorting options
  - [x] Implement sorting logic
- [x] Violin plot optimization
  - [x] Add bandwidth control
  - [x] Test performance
- [x] Bee swarm optimization
  - [x] Implement sampling
  - [x] Add controls

## Current Progress

- ✅ Implemented color-based filtering
- ✅ Added box click interaction
- ✅ Added axis labels
- ✅ Fixed box coloring
- ✅ Added sorting controls
- ✅ Added violin plot bandwidth control
- ✅ Optimized bee swarm with point sampling
- ✅ All planned improvements completed

### Next Steps

All planned improvements have been implemented. The box plot component now has:

1. Color-based filtering with box click interaction
2. Proper axis labels
3. Correct box coloring based on color field
4. Sorting controls (by median or label)
5. Violin plot bandwidth control
6. Optimized bee swarm with point sampling for large datasets

No further improvements are needed at this time.

## Implementation Details

### Filtering Component Updates

```typescript
interface BoxPlotFilterProps {
  colorField?: string;
  onColorFilter: (value: string) => void;
  onRangeFilter: (range: [number, number]) => void;
}
```

### Box Plot Component Updates

```typescript
interface BoxPlotProps {
  // ... existing props ...
  onBoxClick?: (colorGroup: string) => void;
  sortBy?: "median" | "label";
  violinBandwidth?: number;
  maxPoints?: number;
}
```

### Chart Settings Updates

```typescript
interface BoxPlotSettings {
  // ... existing settings ...
  showAxisLabels: boolean;
  xAxisLabel?: string;
  yAxisLabel?: string;
  sortBy: "median" | "label";
  violinBandwidth: number;
  maxPoints: number;
}
```
