# Summary Chart Notes

- Add a button in the plot manager header to create blank charts of each type

## Summary Table Improvements

- Debounce the slider on the summary table to prevent too many re-renders
- Show the total row count somewhere on the summary table
- Add filtering to the summary table
- Summary table causes a render with each column? Do them all in one shot if possible - check time and then RAF to continue
- Integrate the data summary info into the field chooser drop downs - show icon for field (maybe a count, etc)
