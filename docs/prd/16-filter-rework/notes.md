## Filter rework notes

### Pivot Table

- Not clear how to activate filters - click the search icon - should change to a filter icon
- Should highlight the active filters in the pivot table
- No obvious way to engage a row filter
- Remove the `toast` that appears when a filter is applied

### Related to Data Table

- Needs to be case insensitive for contains and other text filters
- Should include option to filter only the component or to filter the entire crossfilter context
- Global search seems to not work - does it search all fields? or just those involved in the display
- Add highlighter when using the global search or other filters
- Show filter as a row below the header - add option to change type
- Add a popover for quick access to advanced filtering options
