# Common prompts

## Build a plan

Update the prd_plan to include an actual implementation plan. Where it makes sense, add interface details and comp outlines (file structure + main props and actions).

Add a STATUS section at bottom that will collect the progress. Fill with an initial status reflecting all work that needs to be done. Mirror the structure shown below (do not use this content).

Structure:

```
## Status

### Phase 1: Sidebar Component

- [ ] Basic sidebar structure
  - [ ] Component scaffolding
  - [ ] Basic styling
  - [ ] Responsive layout

... and so one

## Current Progress

- Bullet list of all work completed

### Next steps

- Bulleted listed of all work remaining

```

## Add detail to plan

Update the plan with interfaces and initial scope for each of the proposed files. For new components, propose the props and any internal state. Do not mention testing or timelines. I am not worried about those. Just the code, its structure, and how it integrates with existing stuff. I will feed these specs into an AI to generate the code.

## Continue along the plan

Continue implementing the plan as detailed in the status section of the `plans` file. Update the status section as you go. Try to tackle as much work as possible in one go! I know you can do it!!! You should finish the plan on this sprint.
