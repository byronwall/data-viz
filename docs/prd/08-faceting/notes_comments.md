# Notes and comments for faceting

- Need to show all facets - show blanks when filtering - add an option to hide facets in wrap mode
- Filtering causes the axis limits to be constrained when faceted - will not return to full scale when filter is removed
- Facetted bar chart with categorical x-axis does not work

## Issues to resolve in new work

- The colorScaleId should not be saved - or need to save the scales too
- Decide if it is worth allowing the y categories to be globally shared in Row charts w/ facets
- Need to implement the full suite of control for axis limits - scatter defaults to all available global data
