# 3D Scatter Plot

## Overview

A 3D scatter plot visualization that allows users to explore relationships between three variables in an interactive way.

## Core Requirements

### Data and Variables

- Support for three numerical variables (X, Y, Z axes)
- Allow users to select which variables map to which axes
- Support for an optional fourth variable displayed as point color
- Support for an optional fifth variable shown as point size
- Handle both continuous and categorical data for color mapping

### Visualization Features

- Interactive 3D rendering using Three.js
- Proper axis labels and scales
- Color legend when color mapping is used
- Size legend when size mapping is used
- Grid lines for better spatial reference
- Axis ticks and values

### Interactions

- Rotate the plot using mouse drag
- Zoom in/out using mouse wheel
- Pan the view using right-click drag
- Reset view button to return to default orientation
- Hover tooltips showing point details
- Optional point selection for highlighting specific data points
- Camera controls for perspective vs. orthographic views
- Store the camera position and zoom level in the chart state - do a local update and save to the chart state once the user is done interacting

### UI Controls - use existing settings comp

- Dropdown menus for selecting X, Y, and Z variables
- Optional dropdown for color variable selection
- Optional dropdown for size variable selection
- Color scheme selector for categorical/continuous color mapping
- Point size range adjustment
- Opacity control for better viewing of dense data
- Option to toggle grid lines
- Option to toggle axis labels

### Performance

- Handle at least 10,000 points smoothly
- Progressive loading for larger datasets
- Level of detail adjustments during rotation/movement
- Efficient point rendering using WebGL

### Export and Sharing

- Screenshot capability
- Save current view parameters
- Share view configuration

## Technical Requirements

### Implementation

- Use Three.js for 3D rendering
- React components for UI controls
- TypeScript for type safety
- Responsive design that works in different viewport sizes
- Efficient state management for view parameters

### Accessibility

- Keyboard controls for rotation and zoom
- High contrast color schemes
- Screen reader descriptions of trends and patterns
- Alternative 2D views for key relationships

### Error Handling

- Graceful handling of missing data
- Clear error messages for incompatible data types
- Fallback rendering for unsupported browsers
- Loading states during data processing
