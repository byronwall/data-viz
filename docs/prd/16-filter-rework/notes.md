# Filter rework notes

- Update DataLayerProvider to use the new filter functions
- Data table needs to be case insensitive
- Data table should include option to globally filter vs. just local table
- Data table global search seems to not work
- Pivot table - not clear how to activate filters

## Questions

- Curious how the create + update + apply functions will work
- DataTable got wrecked by filter updates - will need to revert and do manually
