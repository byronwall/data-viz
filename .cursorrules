# Rules

- ALWAYS RUN TESTS BEFORE REVIEWING CODE

- use pnpm as package manager
- use typescript
- use tailwind css for styling
- use react
- use shadcn/ui for components
- use lucide-react for icons

- DO NOT offer to install shadcn/ui components, they are all installed already
- DO NOT change comments when doing refactors or other work
- DO NOT alter functionality when refactoring. Again, DO NOT modify existing functionality unless I've explicitly asked you to.
- DO NOT change `className` or other styling unless EXPLICITLY asked to do so.
- When creating new comps or adding functionality DO NOT EDIT OTHER STUFF. DO NOT REFACTOR OTHER STUFF even if it looks like a good idea.

- Use import + `useState` etc instead of `React.useState` etc.
- When accessing zustand stores, always use a selector for a SINGLE item. Repeat each line for as many items as needed.

## Comp preferences

- When creating toasts, use `sonner` via `import { toast } from "sonner"` and `toast("Event has been created.")`. The relevant providers are in place.
- For alert dialogs, use `useAlertStore` via `import { useAlertStore } from "@/stores/alertStore"`. DO NOT USE `confirm`. DO NOT import `AlertDialog`
- Use the `NumericInputEnter` component for numeric inputs. DO NOT USE `input` with `type="number"`
- Use the `ComboBox` component for dropdowns. DO NOT use `Select` components.
- When adding settings with a label, prefer the 2 column layout with the label on the left and the component on the right.
