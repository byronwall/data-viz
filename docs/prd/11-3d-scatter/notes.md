# 3D Scatter Notes

- Need to load the data correctly using the useGetColumnDataForIds hook in the main comp
- Need to update crossfilter to know about the new type - create a default filter for the new type
- Issue with first render not showing correctly - need to drag chart around or force a render to get it to render
