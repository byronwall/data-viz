# Transcript of several chart types

This transcript was generated by chatting with ChatGPT Advanced Voice Mode. I then copy the resulting web page and dumped to this file. With the transcript I generated the chart type PRDs.

## Contents

Hi there! How can I help you today?

You said:
“I'm creating a data visualization system, and I want to talk through the features of it, specifically the features related to charting and all of the different visual and statistical elements.”
00:13
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely! Let's dive into the charting features. Here are some key elements you might consider:

Chart Types:
Bar Charts: Great for comparing quantities.
Line Charts: Useful for showing trends over time.
Pie Charts: Ideal for

You said:
“Yeah, so I know what charts I want. I'm going to talk through them and all the features, and then I want you to ask questions about missing features. Ultimately, I'm going to use the transcript of this conversation to define the scope of the project. So start by just asking me, what's the first chart type that you want to add?”
00:18
ChatGPT said:
Sounds good! What's the first chart type you want to add?

You said:
“The first chart type that I'm going to add...”
00:01
ChatGPT said:
Got it! What are some key features you want for bar charts?

You said:
“corresponds to the count. If there's too many bars to render...”
00:05
ChatGPT said:
You might want to consider features like:

Aggregation Options:
Summing or averaging values when there are too many bars.
Pagination or Scroll:
To manage large datasets.
Grouping and Stacking:
For comparing multiple series.
Anything else you'd like to include for bar charts?

You said:
“Phone disconnected.”
00:01
ChatGPT said:
No problem! If you want to continue discussing features or have any questions, feel free to let me know!

You said:
“Reread what she just said.”
00:01
ChatGPT said:
Sure thing! Here’s what I mentioned:

For bar charts, you might consider:

Aggregation Options:
Summing or averaging values when there are too many bars.
Pagination or Scroll:
To manage large datasets.
Grouping and Stacking:
For comparing multiple series.
Anything else you'd like to know or add?

You said:
“Um, no, let's move on to what I'm calling the bar chart, which is a, uh, the bar is oriented vertically. Uh, it's meant to support numerical and categorical data, so if the incoming data series is numerical, the bars will present a histogram-looking distribution. Uh, if the data is categorical, it's just going to present a band-style axis that, uh, again counts each item. Um, the bar chart supports filtering, so the user can browse for click-to-drag, uh, they can either click on a single chart, or excuse me, a single bar, and it'll filter that item, uh, or they can click-to-drag a range, so min to max, and it'll filter accordingly. Um, the user can, uh, color the bars either by the original variable, in which case they'll use the numerical, uh, scale for the coloring. They can also color the bars by a different variable, uh, and it will do a, uh, stacked, stacked bar style where the original bar is replaced with a stack of colors that corresponds to the count of the original variable, excuse me, of the variable that's being used for coloring. Um, ask some questions about that approach.”
01:16
ChatGPT said:
Your approach for the bar chart sounds robust. A few questions to refine it:

For numerical data, do you plan to support custom bin sizes for the histogram-like distribution?
How will you handle overlapping filters when users select multiple ranges or categories?
For coloring by a different variable, are there options to customize the color palette

You said:
“Yeah, so let's do the questions one at a time. So for the bins, yes, the user can supply custom bin definitions, either a custom bin count or a custom bin interval.”
00:10
ChatGPT said:
That's great! For overlapping

You said:
“I guess maybe if they really wanted, they could supply custom, like, bin ranges. So, like, an array of breakpoints, maybe. Yeah, what was the next question?”
00:09
ChatGPT said:
Sure! The next question was: How do you plan to handle overlapping filters when users select multiple ranges or categories?

You said:
“Um, yeah, overlapping filters, uh, they combine, uh, basically it applies an OR, um, it's possible if they're clicking on single bars, uh, so yeah, they're going to combine in an OR.”
00:11
ChatGPT said:
Got it! And for the coloring by a different variable, will there be options to customize the color palette or the method of stacking (e.g., side-by-side vs. stacked bars)?

You said:
“So color palette is defined elsewhere in the system. There's a global set of color palettes. So I'll use that. The user can configure those separately. With respect to the stacking options, they will stack on top of each other. Side-by-side is going to ruin the visuals by switching from colored to non-colored. Yeah, I don't want a layout shift. So I need them to stack on top of each other. They need to fit in the original space.”
00:24
ChatGPT said:
That makes sense. Consistent stacking will help maintain the visual integrity. For color customization, leveraging a global set of palettes is a solid approach. Are there any other features or elements you want to discuss for the bar chart before we move on?

You said:
“What sounds like it might be missing from the bar chart? What could I do to really add some pop?”
00:04
ChatGPT said:
To add some extra pop to your bar chart:

Animations:
Introduce smooth transitions when data updates or filters are applied.
Interactive Tooltips:
Provide detailed information on hover for each bar or section.
Highlighting:
Highlight bars on hover to draw user attention to specific data points.
Would any of these features align with your vision?

You said:
“Um, no, generally I prefer no animation, both for implementation complexity and the visual distraction. I think the hover stuff is kind of interesting. Let's put a pin in that. Maybe we'll come back to that as like a general feature. But let's move on to the next chart type, which is gonna be scatter charts.”
00:20
ChatGPT said:
Sure! Let's talk about scatter charts. What features are you considering for them?

You said:
“So in terms of overlapping points, they just overlap. Yes, the user will have the ability to control the opacity of the points, so they can supply a zero to one. With respect to point size, that's a good thought to add in data-dependent sizing. I typically have avoided it, but honestly, it's a fine feature to throw in, and then let the user control the scale for the sizing. I guess while I'm at it, you may as well just let them control the symbol against the scale as well, so that way they can have a different data plot with a different symbol. That probably gives every imaginable combination for a scatterplot.”
00:37

2/2

ChatGPT said:
That sounds like a versatile setup! With control over opacity, size, and symbol, users will have a lot of customization. Anything else you’re considering for scatter charts, or should we move on to the next chart type?

You said:
“So for scatter charts, the user will also have the ability to optionally specify a second Y variable to plot on a second Y-axis. That second Y-axis will have the ability to be synchronized to the main Y-axis, or it can be separate. I'll have to come up with some visual scheme that keeps them separate. I really don't like having two sets of data on the chart, but so be it. I think some people want to do that, so I need to support it. You asked about regression lines and trend lines. Yes, there will be support for regression lines and trend lines. The initial support will be linear and polynomial regressions. I'll also add support for a low S regressor. That way you can have a locally smooth option. And I'll probably go ahead and also add support for some sort of exponentially weighted moving average, some sort of smoother that's not a local regression, but more traditional.”
00:54
ChatGPT said:
That’s a comprehensive plan! Supporting a second Y-axis with synchronization options and visual differentiation will be useful. Including various regression lines and smoothers offers great flexibility. Are there any other features you'd like to add to scatter charts, or shall we move on?

You said:
“What other questions might you have about a scatter chart? Ask them one at a time.”
00:04
ChatGPT said:
Sure! How do you plan to handle tooltip information for scatter charts? Will users be able to customize what data is shown on hover?

You said:
“No tooltips, I'm rendering to Canvas and I just don't wanna deal with tooltips, at least initially.”
00:04
ChatGPT said:
Got it, no tooltips initially. Are you considering any specific performance optimizations for handling large datasets, given the use of canvas rendering?

You said:
“Yeah, it'll render to Canvas. I will attempt to make it as efficient as possible. I might try and make use of progressive rendering to render the data set kind of as it comes. I'll attempt to have rendering stuff that's off screen. That'll probably help. But otherwise, I don't know. I expect the data sets to be around a million points. And you can render that to Canvas somewhat comfortably.”
00:24
ChatGPT said:
That sounds like a solid strategy. Progressive rendering and off-screen culling should help keep performance smooth. Anything else you'd like to discuss for scatter charts, or should we move to the next chart type?

You said:
“What else might be missing from scatter charts?”
00:01
ChatGPT said:
You might consider:

Zoom and Pan: Allowing users to zoom into specific areas and pan across the chart.
Grid Lines and Axis Labels: Customizable grid lines and labels for better readability.
Would these features be beneficial?

You said:
“Yeah, I had planned to implement access gridline type stuff. So assume that's baked in. With respect to Zoom and PAN, let's talk through that. Would it be in place or side by side?”
00:10
ChatGPT said:
Zoom and pan can be implemented in different ways:

In-place: Users zoom and pan directly within the existing chart area, offering a more interactive experience.
Side-by-side: Users can select a region to zoom into, and a new detailed view appears alongside the original chart.
Which approach aligns better with your system's goals?

You said:
“either. Yeah, the side-by-side, I don't like the layout shift of stuff either duplicating or becoming half size. It could maybe work if the chart's big to have like a little mini-map kind of thing on it. If that's kind of in the corner or out of the way, that might work.”
00:17
ChatGPT said:
A mini-map is a

You said:
“I think the inline zooming gets pretty close to what I'm already supporting with respect to like overriding access limits. And so maybe there's some way to just provide better usability around the access limit modification using keyboard or mouse instead of having to like type in. That's probably as far as I go in terms of implementing zooming or panning in place.”
00:23
ChatGPT said:
That sounds practical. Enhancing usability with keyboard and mouse controls for axis limit adjustments can offer a seamless experience without complicating the layout. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss regarding scatter charts, or should we move on to the next chart type?

You said:
“Does anything else sound like it's missing with respect to scatter charts?”
00:02
ChatGPT said:
Your scatter chart setup seems quite comprehensive. One final consideration might be:

Export Options: Allowing users to export the chart as an image or data file.
Would this be useful, or do you feel your current plan is complete?

You said:
“Yeah, all of the charts support exporting to an image and then export the data. There's a separate feature to export data, although maybe I can put a button on a chart that scopes it to just the fields in the current chart, so that might work.”
00:15
ChatGPT said:
That sounds like a great addition. Adding an export button directly on the chart for scoped data could enhance user convenience. If there's nothing else on scatter charts, what's the next chart type you'd like to discuss?

You said:
“It's not a ChartType, but a PivotTable.”
00:01
ChatGPT said:
Got it! What features are you considering for the pivot table?

You said:
“So for the pivot table, its core data selectors are the row fields, column fields, and then the cell values or the pivot values.”
00:09
ChatGPT said:
That makes sense.

You said:
“The row and column fields are multi-selectors, so the user can select as many data fields as they want from the original source data. The pivoting logic will go select all the unique values for each field. It'll then stack those side-by-side, or for the column option, it'll go get all the unique values and put them in the columns. And then for the values, the user specifies the field to act on and the aggregating function. And then the pivot table renders all that using visuals that are consistent with how Excel and every other pivot table implements that.”
00:36
ChatGPT said:
That's a solid foundation. A couple of considerations:

Filtering and Sorting Options: Will users be able to filter and sort data within the pivot table?
Subtotals and Grand Totals: Will you provide automatic calculation

You said:
“Yeah, all include options for subtotals and grand totals. I'm not a huge fan of them personally, but people use them. So they need to be present, they need to work.”
00:10
ChatGPT said:
Got it. Subtotals and grand totals are definitely useful for many users. Are there any specific formatting options you'd like to offer, like conditional formatting or custom styles?

You said:
“Conditional formatting is a decent thought, so yeah, maybe there's a way to specify conditional formatting. The other detail is if the user is inputting date fields or fields that are known to be timestamps, I'd like to make it easy to automatically bin and bucket by day, year, month, that kind of information, rather than making the user go and create those fields manually. There is a whole calculation engine in this system, so the user can create fields automatically. Not automatically, I mean, it's a type, but it'd be way easier if the pivot table could either create those date fields automatically or just do it internally for the pivot table.”
00:43
ChatGPT said:
That's a great idea. Automatically binning date fields into day, month, and year categories would definitely enhance usability. Are there any other features or functionalities you're thinking of for the pivot table?

You said:
“What might be missing?”
00:01
ChatGPT said:
You might consider:

Drill-down Capabilities: Allowing users to expand and see detailed data for specific rows or columns.
Custom Calculations: Enabling users to define custom formulas within the pivot table.
Would these be helpful additions?

You said:
“Yeah, so with respect to drilling down, I will let the user click on a cell, and then they can see all the rows that are included in that cell. It'll pop up some modal popover interface with a pagination or something. With respect to calculated fields, I will add support for a calculated expression, which is based on any of the existing values in the pivot table. So calculations will be supported with some sort of custom syntax.”
00:27
ChatGPT said:
That sounds like a comprehensive setup. Implementing drill-down capabilities with a modal and supporting calculated fields with custom syntax will provide users with powerful tools for data analysis. Anything else you'd like to add for the pivot table?

You said:
“Uh, what else is missing?”
00:01
ChatGPT said:
You might also consider:

Export Options: Allowing users to export the pivot table data or view.
Customizable Layouts: Enabling users to save and switch between different pivot table layouts or configurations.
Would these be useful additions?

You said:
“Yeah, so exporting, that will be supported. The user can click a button and export to CSV. In terms of custom views, these charts live inside of a global view system, so you can absolutely save those. Let's go ahead and, would it be useful to include local saved views? I'm gonna say no. I'm gonna say the user's gonna use the global view system to save specific views of the BIM table.”
00:28
ChatGPT said:
That makes sense. Using the global view system for saving configurations should keep things consistent. Anything else you'd like to discuss about the pivot table, or are we ready to move on?

You said:
“Is anything else missing?”
00:01
ChatGPT said:
Your pivot table setup seems quite robust. Perhaps consider:

User Permissions: Allowing different levels of access or editing capabilities.
Performance Optimization: Handling large datasets efficiently.
If everything else is covered, we can move on.

You said:
“Yeah, let's move on. The next chart type is going to be a data table.”
00:06
ChatGPT said:
Great! What features are you considering for the data table?

You said:
“Yeah, so the data table is a pretty just simple raw dump of the internal data structure. Its core selectors are the fields to be displayed, so the user can choose which fields to display. The amount of data is presumably going to be vast, and so the data table will be paginated. It will allow for local sorting and filtering. So the user has the ability to sort and filter what's being displayed in the data table. That will be local only. Those filters will not, I don't know, maybe they will. Maybe they will integrate into the global system. I'll have to think about that. Yeah, the data table will also support for columns. They can be colored by the global color scales, so if the user wants to color a column, they can check to color a column. If the user wants to group rows, that's probably useful. So allow the user to specify grouping fields in addition to the data fields. Grouping may as well make it hierarchical, so make that a multi-select, and I'll allow for kind of grouped with collapsing. At that point, it's almost like a pivot table where it's just showing the raw data instead of the aggregate values. Let's go ahead and keep them separate, though. I don't want pivoting means aggregating to most people. What else? At the top of the data table in each of the column headers, there will be a small rendering of the distribution of the data. So for numerical data, it'll show a distribution of the histogram. For categorical data, I think it'll show a little histogram, but it's going to be really hard to read. So I don't know. Maybe just numerical data gets the histograms. I'll have to think about that.”
01:50
ChatGPT said:
That’s a comprehensive plan. Including histograms for numerical data distribution in column headers is a neat touch. For categorical data, perhaps using a bar chart with counts might be more readable. Anything else you’re considering for the data table?

You said:
“What might be missing?”
00:01
ChatGPT said:
Consider adding:

Row Selection: Allowing users to select multiple rows for bulk actions or detailed analysis.
Export Options: Exporting filtered or selected data directly from the table.
Would these be helpful?

You said:
“Bulk selection, probably not. I think, ultimately, users are gonna use the overall filtering system for selecting. Although, I don't know, honestly, for a couple of checkboxes, let's just throw it in. We'll have a column of checkboxes that the user can select. Who knows, maybe they'll do it. And then add a button called Select All at the top. That way, they can select everything if they want to. For export, yes, the user will be able to export the data, and it'll ultimately be a subset of the global data, whatever's rendered.”
00:28
ChatGPT said:
That sounds like a plan! Adding checkboxes and a "Select All" button provides flexibility, and export options will be quite useful. Anything else for the data table, or should we move on?

You said:
“What else might be missing?”
00:01
ChatGPT said:
You might also consider:

In-line Editing: Allowing users to edit data directly within the table.
Column Resizing: Enabling users to adjust column widths for better readability.
Would these features be useful?

You said:
“Column resizing, definitely. Inline editing, definitely not. We don't want to edit the data.”
00:07
ChatGPT said:
Got it. Column resizing for better readability is a great addition. If there's nothing else, are you ready to move on to the next topic?

You said:
“Yeah, make a note that column resizing should support the double-click equals attempt to autosize. That's always nice when it exists.”
00:07
ChatGPT said:
Memory updated
Noted! The double-click auto-sizing feature will definitely enhance usability. Anything else you'd like to discuss?

You said:
“Is anything else missing?”
00:01
ChatGPT said:
Your data table plan seems quite thorough. If anything else comes up, feel free to revisit it. Ready to move on?

You said:
“Yeah, let's move on to heat maps.”
00:02
ChatGPT said:
Great! What features are you considering for heat maps?

You said:
“So the heat map, the core data selector is the row field and the column field. So it's going to be a X by Y kind of arrangement, row by column arrangement, single variable selection, where at the intersection of the row and column, it will report the count of the data.”
00:20
ChatGPT said:
Got it! Are you planning to support different color gradients or customizable color scales for the heat map?

You said:
“Yes, the user can supply or choose between an option of color scales for the counts.”
00:06
ChatGPT said:
That's great! Offering customizable color scales will add flexibility. Are there any plans for tooltips or detailed information when users hover over specific cells?

You said:
“What would I show in a tooltip?”
00:01
ChatGPT said:
Tooltips could display:

The exact row and column values.
The count or value at that intersection for quick reference.
Would that be helpful?

You said:
“Um, let's add support for like a drill-down type mode where the user can click and get a modal of the raw rows that are inside the cell. That'll use the same functionality as the pivot table drill-down, so that'll be easy once it exists.”
00:12
ChatGPT said:
That sounds like a great idea! Leveraging the same drill-down functionality from the pivot table for heat maps would provide consistency and ease of implementation. Anything else you're considering for heat maps?

You said:
“What else might be missing?”
00:01
ChatGPT said:
You might consider:

Thresholds/Highlighting: Allowing users to set thresholds for different color intensities.
Grid Lines: Option to toggle grid lines for better cell differentiation.
Would these be useful additions?

You said:
“But yeah, gridlines, those will be included. Ultimately, it's going to, yeah, it'll render as a table with borders. So I think I'll get gridlines for free, but yeah, note that. And then thresholds slash highlighting. Yeah, that's a decent idea. Let's implement that in the color scale. Let's allow the user to specify a custom color scale with custom breakpoints. And then that'll take care of whatever whimsy they have with respect to breakpoints or thresholds or conditional formatting.”
00:29
ChatGPT said:
That’s a flexible approach! Allowing custom color scales with breakpoints will give users plenty of control. Anything else you'd like to add for heat maps, or is there another feature to discuss?

You said:
“What else might be missing on heatmaps? Be detailed.”
00:02
ChatGPT said:
For heat maps, consider:

Interactivity: Options like zooming or panning to explore detailed data patterns.
Data Normalization: Features for normalizing data across rows or columns for better visual comparison.
Would these features enhance your heat map design?

You said:
“Yes, so data normalization, let's go ahead and include that. There'll be some sort of option to plot as a percentage instead of a raw count. So like percent of row total, percent of column total, percent of grand total. So basically like the heat map rendered percentages instead of raw counts. I like that. With respect to zooming and panning, no, let's not do that. But let's talk through filtering. So all charts support filtering. For the heat map, the user will have the ability to click on either a row or a column or a cell and it will create the corresponding filter either for that row or column or cell. And then the heat map will also have the ability to specify AND or OR type filters, because in some cases you want the intersection of a row and column, in some cases you want the union of a row and column.”
00:49
ChatGPT said:
That's a thoughtful approach. Including options to plot percentages will be quite useful. The filtering capabilities you described—clickable rows, columns, and cells, along with AND/OR filtering options—will offer powerful data exploration. Anything else for the heat maps, or are we set?

You said:
“What else might be missing?”
00:01
ChatGPT said:
Your heat map setup is quite comprehensive. You might also think about:

Data Labels: Option to display values directly on the heat map cells.
Export Options: Allowing users to export the heat map as an image or data file.
Would these be beneficial?

You said:
“Oh yeah, exporting as image, that's supported everywhere. Exporting as a table, yeah, let's go ahead and add that so the user can export the headers and counts to CSV or something, that's good.”
00:10
ChatGPT said:
Perfect! Including both image and table exports will definitely be useful. It sounds like you have a solid plan for heat maps. Anything else, or should we move on?

You said:
“Let's move on.”
00:00
ChatGPT said:
Alright, what's the next feature you'd like to discuss?

You said:
“Let's talk about Parallel Coordinate Charts.”
00:01
ChatGPT said:
Sure! What features are you considering for parallel coordinate charts?

You said:
“So Parallel Coordinate Charts, the core selector is going to be the fields to render. So the user will choose the fields that they want to render. Each field will render to basically an axis rendered in space. And then for that axis, each data series that's included is going to render as a line across the axes. So they'll be laid out side by side by side, or I guess maybe vertically as well. So make that an option. But the user will basically choose the fields that they want and then lines will get drawn through the axes at the corresponding intersection point. There will be a color variable. So the user can choose how to color the line. That will be some third or nth variable that may or may not be present in the data. For numerical data, it's just going to render to a continuous scale. For categorical data, it's going to render to a band file scale. I probably need some global system of orderings. That way the user can specify the order that the categorical scale appears in. So let's make note of that. And then with respect to filtering, the user can add a filter on any of the field choices for numerical data. The filters will be min-max style for categorical data. It'll be click, click, click inclusion style. That's probably a pretty good starting point.”
01:24
ChatGPT said:
That’s a solid foundation! Including options for both numerical and categorical data, as well as customizable color variables and ordering, will make the chart quite versatile. Are you also considering any features for highlighting specific data series or interactivity like zooming and panning?

You said:
“Oh, zooming and panning. Yeah, there's probably some need to allow the user to specify new limits for each axis, so custom axis limits, and then maybe add some interactivity or usability improvements around doing that quickly. With respect to highlighting, I think I'm gonna use the color variable for that purpose. And so if the user wants to highlight specific rows, they can go tag those rows with row-level metadata and then color on that variable.”
00:34
ChatGPT said:
That makes sense. Allowing custom axis limits and leveraging the color variable for highlighting specific rows can provide a lot of flexibility. Are there any other features you’re considering for parallel coordinate charts?

You said:
“What else might be missing?”
00:01
ChatGPT said:
You might also consider:

Axis Reordering: Allowing users to drag and reorder the axes for better comparison.
Brush Selection: Enabling users to select and highlight specific ranges directly on the chart.
Would these features be helpful?

You said:
“Also, access reordering, that'll be handled in the field collector. They can just reorder it there, and then I'll respect the order that they've chosen them in. With respect to the brushing, yeah, that's going to be handled by the filtering. So, everything I described about filtering, assume I said brushing, I regard those as the same.”
00:18
ChatGPT said:
That sounds great! With axis reordering in the field selector and brushing handled through filtering, your parallel coordinate charts are well-equipped. Anything else you'd like to add or discuss?

You said:
“What else might be missing?”
00:01
ChatGPT said:
Your setup seems comprehensive. If anything else comes up, we can always revisit. Ready to move on to the next topic?

You said:
“Yeah, just make a note that the parallel coordinates are going to render to Canvas. That's going to be necessary in order to have any sort of performance, since it's going to be tens of thousands of lines. Oh, and also make a note that the lines probably need to have some sort of opacity, because there's going to be tens of thousands of them.”
