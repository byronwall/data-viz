# Line Chart Component Requirements

## Core Features

- Plot (x,y) data points with time-based x-axis support
- Support single or multiple data series
- Responsive SVG-based rendering
- TypeScript/React implementation

## Data Structure

- Support array of datasets, each with:
  - Label for the series
  - Array of points with x (Date/number) and y (number) values
- Handle time series data as primary use case

## Configuration Options

### Chart Dimensions

- Configurable width and height
- Configurable margins (top, right, bottom, left)

### Axes

- X-axis configuration
  - Label text
  - Tick count
  - Tick format function - add functions to detect date formats and automatically format them
  - Scale type (time/linear)
- Y-axis configuration
  - Label text
  - Tick count
  - Tick format function
  - Scale type (linear/log/pow)

### Visual Styling

- Line customization
  - Stroke color
  - Stroke width
  - Curve interpolation type (linear, monotoneX, etc.)
- Data point markers
  - Toggle visibility
  - Configurable radius
- Grid lines
  - Toggle x/y grid lines
  - Customizable color

### Interactive Features

- Tooltip on hover
  - Configurable format
  - Show/hide toggle
- Legend
  - Show/hide toggle
  - Position options (top, bottom, left, right)

## Advanced Features (Optional/Future)

- Zoom and pan support
- Allow creating a sub-chart by brushing a region - create the new chart below the current one with new axes
- Brush selection for time range
- Multiple y-axes support - start with a right axis - will expand in the future to allow multiple y-axes
- Performance optimizations for large datasets - bucket the data into N=width buckets. For each bucket, determine the start/min/max and plot the line through those points (with the current times)
- Crosshair on hover
