# Data Viz

Tool for exploratory and interactive data analysis.

![](docs/main-image.png)

## Features

Will be updated when done...

## Major work remaining

- Calc engine - around 50% done - add more functions, including special ones

### Core data viz

- Add support for faceting
- Top level filter + steps = ability to quickly segment data and work on slices
- Improve UX everywhere
  - Settings needs a numeric input that works
  - Settings needs to have tabs + maybe search + more settings + overflow
  - Add keyboard shortcuts + a guide
- Allow controlling settings better
  - Grid layout
- Add a filter summary + filter controller
- Wire up "load examples" buttons for main data sets - get rid of current default state
- Improve handling of times stamps

### Packaging and usages

- Export the core data viewer as a component to be installed elsewhere
- Allow the comp to export the current config so it can be brought into code easily
- Split out the chart components, so that the charting portion can be rented on its own with just data as props make it so that users can use it without needing all of the cross filter machinery still show a setting button that way they can self configure the chart

### Docs and help

- Write up the motivation for the project
- Create a full doc site with helper images
- Create some videos showing usage

## Nice to haves

- Add GPS maps + data display
  - Figure out how to do chloropleth maps
- Add supporting for multiple data sources and relationships
- Add data isolation + "fork" modes - create tabbed interfaces for these
- Create a SPLOM comp that renders scatter plot matrices
- Add a UMAP or TSNE comp that shows clusters from embeddings
- Global color themes

## Small problems

- Got a weird double scroll bar on plot manager
- Scatter plot needs to allow new drag filter on off-click if already brushed
- Charts are all missing consistent gridlines
- Bools should be shown as `true`/`false` not `1`/`0`
- Clicking on a numerical bar chart should filter by the width of the bar
- ChartActions - tooltip is annoying - slow down or remove (add a legend?)
- Debounce the slider on the summary table to prevent too many re-renders
- Show the total row count somewhere on the summary table
- Verify that null detection is working correctly
- Add filtering to the summary table
- Bar chart needs a bunch of visual tweaks
  - Give option to render label on top of bar (instead of to left; affects the axis def)
  - Set a max length on that label
  - Allow ordering by label
  - Allow keeping 0 count items in display to avoid layout shift when filtering
- Need to swap out the multi select comp with good one from Plantasktic
- Add button to create blank chart by choosing type
- Allow the summary table to show up in a popover if the sidebar is collapsed
- `Remove all charts` needs a warning
- Default chart width needs to allow 4-5 charts in grid (12 and 2?)
- Need to build chart title from data fields
- Scatter points need to render on top of gridlines
- Add small grid marks to the background of the chart containing interface so that itâ€™s clear where the size break points are
- Calculation def should describe the available fields created by the calc - default is just producing the calc name - regression would generate estimate, residual, etc. need to declare in advance so drop down menus show what is possible
- bar chart - figure out why barChartPureFilter is not being used
